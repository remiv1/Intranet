Represents a color in the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) color model.

The CMYK color model, also known as process color, is used in color printing and describes the printing
process itself. CMYK refers to the four ink plates used in color printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black).

The model works by masking colors on a lighter, typically white, background. The ink reduces the light
that would otherwise be reflected, and this subtractive model "subtracts" red, green, and blue from white light.
White light minus red leaves cyan, minus green leaves magenta, and minus blue leaves yellow.

In contrast to additive models like RGB, where white is a combination of all primary lights and black is
the absence of light, CMYK works oppositely. White is the paper's natural color, while black results
from combining all inks. To achieve deeper black tones and reduce ink usage, black ink is often used
instead of a combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow.
