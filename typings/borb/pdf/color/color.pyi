"""
Represents the characteristic of visual perception described through color categories like red, green, and blue.

Color perception is derived from the stimulation of photoreceptor cells, particularly cone cells in the human eye,
by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. The color associated with an object is influenced by the
wavelengths of light reflected from the object and its intensity, determined by the object's physical properties
such as absorption and emission spectra.
