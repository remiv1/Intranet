A filter class for processing PDF page content streams, specifically targeting content that appears to the left of a specified image within the PDF page.

The `LeftOfImage` filter identifies and processes content located to the left of a given image
on the PDF page. This can be particularly useful when you want to extract or manipulate text or
objects that are positioned to the left of a particular image, enabling precise content targeting.
