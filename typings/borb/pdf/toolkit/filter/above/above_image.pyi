"""
A filter class for processing PDF page content streams to selectively retain content that appears above image elements on the page.

`AboveImage` extends `PageContentStreamFilter` to provide specialized filtering within a
PDF page's content stream, isolating content that appears visually above image objects.
This can be useful for various document processing tasks, such as extracting or modifying
text or vector graphics that are positioned above images on the page.

This class is typically used in contexts where content segregation based on image position
is required, such as in PDF content analysis, layered content extraction, or visual structure
modifications in a PDF.
