The 'g' operator: Set the nonstroking gray level.

This operator sets the current nonstroking color space to DeviceGray (or the DefaultGray
color space, as specified in section 8.6.5.6, "Default Colour Spaces") and assigns
a gray level for nonstroking operations. The `gray` operand must be a number between
0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white).

This operator is commonly used for setting fill colors in grayscale.
