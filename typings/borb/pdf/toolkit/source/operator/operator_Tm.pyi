"""
The 'Tm' operator: Set the text matrix and text line matrix.

This operator sets the text matrix (Tm) and the text line matrix (Tlm) to the specified
values. These matrices control the positioning and orientation of text. The operands
represent a matrix in the form:
    [ a b 0 ]
    [ c d 0 ]
    [ e f 1 ]
The operands are passed as six separate numbers (a, b, c, d, e, f), and the matrix
specified replaces the current text matrix and text line matrix rather than being
concatenated.

Note:
    - The initial value for Tm and Tlm is the identity matrix: [ 1 0 0 1 0 0 ].
    - This operator directly defines the transformation applied to text, influencing
      both position and scale.
