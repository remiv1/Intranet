The 'v' operator: Append a cubic Bézier curve to the current path.

This operator appends a cubic Bézier curve segment to the current path. The curve starts
from the current point and ends at the point (x3, y3). The current point and the point
(x2, y2) are used as the Bézier control points to define the shape of the curve. After the
operation, the new current point is set to (x3, y3).
