"""
The 'gs' operator: Set graphics state parameters.

This operator modifies the graphics state by applying parameters from a specified graphics
state dictionary. The `dictName` operand must be a name object referencing an entry in the
ExtGState subdictionary of the current resource dictionary.

Graphics state parameters can include settings such as line width, line cap style, miter
limit, transparency, and other rendering properties.

Introduced in PDF 1.2.

Refer to the PDF specification for more details on the ExtGState subdictionary and its usage.
