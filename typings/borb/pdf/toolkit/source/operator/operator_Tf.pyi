"""
The 'Tf' operator: Set the text font and size.

This operator sets the font and size for subsequent text operations. The operand
for this operator is a font name (which must be defined in the current resource
dictionary) and a size in text space units.

The font is specified by a name object, which corresponds to an entry in the
Font subdictionary of the current resource dictionary. The size is specified as
a number, which represents the size of the text in unscaled text space units.

After this operator is executed, all subsequent text drawing operators will use
this font and size until another 'Tf' operator is encountered.

Note:
    - The font name must refer to a font in the current resource dictionary.
    - The size is expressed in unscaled text space units, and it is used to scale
      text characters when drawing text.
