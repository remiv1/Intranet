"""
The `OperatorSingleQuote` class: Implements the `'` operator for text positioning and display.

The `'` operator in a PDF content stream moves to the next line and displays a text string.
This operator is shorthand for the sequence:

    T*
    string Tj

Where:
- `T*` moves to the start of the next line (based on the current leading).
- `Tj` displays the given text string.

This operator is typically used in text streams to simplify commands that involve moving to a new line
and displaying text in a single step.
