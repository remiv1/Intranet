        Initialize a QR code object with specific layout and styling options.

        This constructor creates a QR code based on the provided `qr_code_data`, along with
        additional customization options like the QR code type, border properties, alignment,
        margins, padding, and more. It allows for flexible control over how the QR code will
        be displayed within a PDF layout.

        :param qr_code_data:            The data to be encoded within the QR code, typically a string representing a URL, text, or other information.
        :param qr_code_type:            The type of QR code to generate, such as `QRCodeType.REGULAR`. Defaults to `QRCodeType.REGULAR`.
        :param background_color:        The background color of the QR code. Defaults to white.
        :param border_color:            The color of the border around the QR code, if any.
        :param border_dash_pattern:     A list of integers defining the dash pattern of the border.
        :param border_dash_phase:       The phase offset for the dash pattern of the border.
        :param border_width_bottom:     The width of the bottom border.
        :param border_width_left:       The width of the left border.
        :param border_width_right:      The width of the right border.
        :param border_width_top:        The width of the top border.
        :param horizontal_alignment:    Specifies how the QR code should be horizontally aligned within its container.
        :param margin_bottom:           The bottom margin around the QR code.
        :param margin_left:             The left margin around the QR code.
        :param margin_right:            The right margin around the QR code.
        :param margin_top:              The top margin around the QR code.
        :param padding_bottom:          The bottom padding inside the QR code container.
        :param padding_left:            The left padding inside the QR code container.
        :param padding_right:           The right padding inside the QR code container.
        :param padding_top:             The top padding inside the QR code container.
        :param size:                    The size of the QR code in (width, height) format. If not provided, the size will be automatically calculated based on the content.
        :param stroke_color:            The color used to draw the QR code.
        :param vertical_alignment:      Specifies how the QR code should be vertically aligned within its container.
