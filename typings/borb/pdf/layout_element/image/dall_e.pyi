        Initialize the DAllE object representing an image generated from a user-specified prompt.

        The `DAllE` class allows users to generate images based on textual descriptions using OpenAI's DALL路E model.
        This constructor initializes the attributes required for the image generation process,
        including the prompt, optional background and border colors, layout options, and size specifications.
        These attributes influence how the image is rendered and displayed within the application.

        :param prompt:                  The textual description that will be sent to DALL路E to generate the image.
        :param background_color:        Optional color for the background of the image. Default is None.
        :param border_color:            Optional color for the border surrounding the image. Default is None.
        :param border_dash_pattern:     A list defining the dash pattern for the border. Default is an empty list.
        :param border_dash_phase:       The phase offset for the dash pattern. Default is 0.
        :param border_width_bottom:     Width of the border at the bottom of the image. Default is 0.
        :param border_width_left:       Width of the border on the left side of the image. Default is 0.

        :param border_width_top:        Width of the border at the top of the image. Default is 0.
        :param horizontal_alignment:    Alignment of the image horizontally within its layout. Default is LayoutElement.HorizontalAlignment.LEFT.
        :param margin_bottom:           Bottom margin for spacing around the image. Default is 0.
