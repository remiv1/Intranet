Represents an alphabetically ordered list of layout elements.

The `ABCOrderedList` class arranges items in a list using an alphabetical
ordering scheme, starting from 'a', 'b', 'c', and continuing through
'z', then 'aa', 'ab', etc. This class is particularly useful for managing
ordered lists in documents where items need to be presented in a sequential,
lettered format.
