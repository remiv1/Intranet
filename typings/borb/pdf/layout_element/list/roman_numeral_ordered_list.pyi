Represents an ordered list of layout elements numbered with Roman numerals.

The `RomanNumeralOrderedList` class is designed to manage a list of layout elements
that are numbered using Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.) instead of Arabic numerals.
Each item in the list is automatically assigned a Roman numeral index based on its
position in the list. This class extends the functionality of a basic ordered list
to provide customized numbering.
