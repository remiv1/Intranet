"""
Represents a bending process layout that visually organizes a series of steps or items along a curved path, illustrating the progression of a process.

This class is designed to display items in a curved, flowing layout, which
can help convey movement, transition, or cyclical progression. Each item
represents a step or stage in the process, and the bending layout enhances
the visual appeal by deviating from a traditional straight-line approach.
This format is ideal for workflows, timelines, or processes that benefit
from a dynamic, flowing presentation.

        Construct a bending process layout with items displayed along a curved path.

        This static method creates a visual layout of a process, arranging each
        item (level 1) along a flowing, curved line to convey a sense of progression
        or continuity. Each item appears as a labeled point along the curve,
        and arrows or lines between items indicate the order of the steps.

        :param level_1_items:       A list of strings representing the primary items or steps in the process.
        :param background_color:    The background color for the layout. Defaults to X11Color.PRUSSIAN_BLUE.
        :param level_1_font_color:  The font color for item labels. Defaults to X11Color.WHITE.
        :param level_1_font_size:   The font size for item labels. Defaults to 12.
