"""
Represents a horizontal layout for displaying a list of items in descending order.

This class organizes items horizontally across the display, with each item
progressively descending to illustrate growth, progression, or increasing
importance. The layout provides a visually intuitive way to show sequences
where each item builds on or improves upon the previous one. It is ideal
for representing steps, rankings, achievements, or any process that benefits
from a sense of upward progression.

        Construct a horizontal descending list layout with items displayed in a progressively elevated order.

        This static method creates a visual layout for displaying items
        horizontally, with each item slightly higher than the previous one
        to indicate upward progression. Customization options for background
        color, font color, and font size allow the layout to be adapted to
        specific visual requirements, making it suitable for representing
