Represents a sound annotation that embeds an audio file in the PDF document.

Sound annotations (PDF 1.3) associate an audio file with a specific point on the page. When activated,
they allow the user to play the embedded audio content. The annotation can be triggered either by
clicking the annotation icon or through other user interactions. The annotation's location and
appearance on the page are determined by the Rect entry in the annotation dictionary.

The audio is stored as a stream in a format suitable for embedding, such as raw PCM or other supported
audio formats. The annotation's appearance can be customized, and the audio content can be played using
PDF viewers that support this feature.
