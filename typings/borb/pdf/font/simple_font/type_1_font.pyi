Represents a Type1 font and its properties in a PDF document.

The `Type1Font` class encapsulates the characteristics of a Type1 font, a widely used
PostScript font format in PDF documents. Type1 fonts are known for their high-quality
rendering and are commonly used in professional printing. This class provides access to
font-specific properties such as glyph mappings, metrics, and other attributes necessary
for rendering Type1 fonts accurately in PDF documents. As a subclass of `SimpleFont`,
it inherits basic font functionality while adding specific properties and behaviors
related to Type1 fonts.
