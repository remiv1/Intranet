"""
Represents a CMap stream in a PDF document.

The `CMap` class encapsulates the functionality of a CMap (Character Map) stream,
which is used in PDF documents to map character codes to Unicode values or to
glyph identifiers in composite fonts. CMaps are essential for rendering text in
PDFs, particularly when dealing with non-standard character encodings or composite
fonts like Type 0 fonts.

This class extends the `stream` class, leveraging its capabilities for managing
PDF stream data, while adding specific methods and attributes for interpreting
CMap data. It supports parsing and interpreting character-to-glyph and
character-to-Unicode mappings.
