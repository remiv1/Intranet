A visitor class for handling the writing or persistence of `bool` objects in the PDF structure.

This class is designed to traverse and process nodes containing `bool` data within the
PDF document structure. It extends the functionality of `WriteNewVisitor` by providing
specific methods to handle the writing of boolean values, ensuring proper formatting

        Traverse the PDF document tree using the visitor pattern.

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
        Subclasses can override this method to provide default behavior or logging
        for unsupported nodes. If any operation is performed on the node (e.g.,
        writing or persisting), the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns
        `False` to indicate that the visitor did not process the node.
