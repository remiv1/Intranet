"""
A specialized PDF visitor that injects versioning and licensing metadata as comments  into a PDF document.

This visitor operates within the `borb` PDF generation and manipulation framework and
extends the `WriteNewVisitor` to insert a version comment block at the beginning of
the PDF serialization. The injected block includes the current `borb` version and
license information (either AGPL or the licensed company name), prefixed with `#`
to conform to comment syntax where applicable.

The visitor is designed to run only once per session to prevent redundant metadata
injection. It uses an internal state flag to enforce single-use behavior. Typically
employed at the root level of a visitor hierarchy, this visitor ensures version
tracking and attribution in generated PDF files, which is useful for diagnostics,
auditing, and support.
