        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
        Subclasses can override this method to provide default behavior or logging
        for unsupported nodes. If any operation is performed on the node (e.g.,
        writing or persisting), the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns
        `False` to indicate that the visitor did not process the node.
