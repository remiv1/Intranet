"""
A class to handle LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) compression decoding in the context of PDF data.

LZW is a lossless data compression algorithm that is used in various contexts, including PDF image
compression. This class provides functionality to decode data that has been compressed using LZW,
which is commonly used for handling image data and other compressed content in a PDF file.

The decoding process involves reversing the LZW encoding algorithm to restore the original, uncompressed
data from the encoded byte sequence. This class can be used for handling compressed data streams
within a PDF document, including but not limited to image streams, object data, and other binary content.

class bitarray:
    """
    A class for working with a byte sequence and retrieving individual bits.

    This class provides functionality for interpreting a sequence of bytes as a series of bits.
    It allows you to extract individual bits (as integers) from a byte sequence, enabling efficient bit-level operations
    commonly needed in algorithms such as compression, encoding, and cryptography.

        This constructor sets up an internal buffer and other variables to handle the processing
        of the byte sequence (`input`). It prepares the object to manage and manipulate the byte
        stream in subsequent operations.

        :param input:   The input byte sequence to be processed.
                        This is typically raw data to be manipulated, decoded, or analyzed within the class.

        Initialize an instance of the LZWDecode class, setting up the initial state for decoding.

        This constructor sets the necessary attributes required for decoding LZW-compressed data:
        - `_bits_to_read`: The number of bits to read for each LZW code (typically 9 bits initially).
        - `_lookup_table`: A dictionary that will be used as a lookup table to store the LZW codes and their corresponding byte sequences.
        - `_table_index`: The current index used to track the next available LZW code in the lookup table.

        These attributes are critical for the LZW decoding process, where the lookup table is progressively built
        as new codes are encountered during decoding, and the number of bits used to read codes may increase as
        more dictionary entries are added.
