"""
Decompresses data encoded using a byte-oriented run-length encoding (RLE) algorithm.

Run-Length Encoding (RLE) is a simple data compression technique that replaces sequences
of the same data value (or byte) occurring in consecutive data elements (runs) with a
single value and a count. This class provides the functionality to decode such compressed
data back into its original form.

RLE is commonly used in scenarios where data has repeated values, such as in monochrome
image compression or certain types of text and binary data.

The algorithm identifies runs of the same byte value and decompresses them by repeating
the byte for the specified number of times, thus reproducing the original data.

        Decompress data encoded using a byte-oriented run-length encoding (RLE) algorithm.

        This method decodes data that was compressed using the RLE technique, where sequences
        of identical bytes are replaced with a single byte value followed by a repetition count.
        During decompression, each encoded sequence is expanded back to its original repeated form.

        The RLE encoding typically follows this format:
        - A length byte `n` is followed by a data byte `b`.
          - If `0 <= n <= 127`, it represents `n + 1` literal bytes (not compressed).
          - If `129 <= n <= 255`, it represents a repeated sequence of `257 - n` instances of `b`.
          - A special marker value `128` may signal the end of the compressed data.

        :return:            The decompressed output bytes.
