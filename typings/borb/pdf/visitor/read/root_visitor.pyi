"""
Visitor class for traversing and processing a PDF document tree.

`FacadeVisitor` implements the visitor pattern to traverse a PDF document
and process different types of nodes within the document. It coordinates
the execution of specialized visitor classes that handle various aspects
of the PDF, such as objects, references, dictionaries, and primitive types.
This class serves as the root visitor for handling and dispatching nodes
to the appropriate handler, allowing for efficient and extensible parsing
and processing of a PDF document.

Key responsibilities:
- Initializes a list of specialized visitors for processing various parts
  of the PDF document (e.g., objects, dictionaries, strings, etc.).
- Provides a `generic_visit` method that serves as the default entry point
  for traversing the document. This method dispatches nodes to the correct
  visitor for handling based on the type of node.
- Handles the overall traversal of the PDF document using a set of visitor
  classes, which process each part of the document as defined by the PDF
  specification.

        Initialize the FacadeVisitor instance and set up the necessary visitors for processing a PDF document.

        This constructor initializes the `FacadeVisitor` by setting up an empty
        list of cross-reference tables (`__xref_tables`), loading required
        visitor classes, and creating a list of visitors to handle different
        parts of the PDF document. It also initializes an empty `__source`
        byte string, which will be populated during traversal.

        This method is called when a node does not have a specialized handler.
        Subclasses can override this method to provide default behavior or logging
        for unsupported nodes. If any operation is performed on the node (e.g.,
        writing or persisting), the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns
